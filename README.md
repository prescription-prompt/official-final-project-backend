# official-final-project-backend
The main backend repo for our Northcoders final project.

You will need to create two .env files for this project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add MONGODB_URI=<Your_MongoDB_connection_URI>, with the correct database name for that environment. Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
